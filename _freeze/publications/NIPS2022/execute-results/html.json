This was a first, and rather naive attempt at understanding the connection between agreement, prevalence, and threshold selection. Readers interested in more sophisticated approaches to these issues are encouraged to look up Guangchao Charles Feng, who has done nice work in this area.\n> \n> <footer>--- Jeffrey Girard, 2018-06-14</footer>",
